# Eclipse GLSP - Node Server

## Direct GModel Library

A collection of reusable base handlers and services to implement GLSP diagram languages directly use the graphical model as source model.
This means the source model is a serializable representation of the graphical model. All operation and action handlers are operating
directly on the graphical model.
