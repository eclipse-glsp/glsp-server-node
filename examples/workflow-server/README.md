# Eclipse GLSP - Workflow Examples

Provides the typescript implementation of the Workflow example server. This example server is used as dev example in GLSP projects.

## Workflow Diagram Example

The workflow diagram is a consistent example provided by all GLSP components.
The example implements a simple flow chart diagram editor with different types of nodes and edges (see screenshot below).
The example can be used to try out different GLSP features, as well as several available integrations with IDE platforms (Theia, VSCode, Eclipse, Standalone).
As the example is fully open source, you can also use it as a blueprint for a custom implementation of a GLSP diagram editor.
See [our project website](https://www.eclipse.org/glsp/documentation/#workflowoverview) for an overview of the workflow example and all components implementing it.
