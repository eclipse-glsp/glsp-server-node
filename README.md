# Node GLSP Server [![Build Status](https://ci.eclipse.org/glsp/job/eclipse-glsp/job/glsp-server-node/job/main/badge/icon)](https://ci.eclipse.org/glsp/job/eclipse-glsp/job/glsp-server-node/job/main/)

Node based server component for the Eclipse Graphical Language Platform (GLSP).
The implementation of this server is aligned with the default Java based [GLSP Server](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server).

The server consists of three components:

-   [`@eclipse-glsp/server-node`](packages/server-node/) The base framework for building node based GLSP servers
-   [`@eclipse-glsp/graph`](packages/graph/) The Typescript based implementation of the graphical model used in GLSP (GModel).
-   [`@eclipse-glsp-examples/workflow-server`](examples/workflow-server) GLSP example server using the workflow model.

## Integration & Features

Currently the node-based API does not yet support the full feature set of the Java GLSP Server API.
Below is a list of features that are currently supported.

## Build

Install dependencies and build via

```console
yarn
```

Only build via

```console
yarn build
```

Lint packages via

```console
yarn lint
```

or do all of the above via

```console
yarn all
```

## Testing

### Unit tests

To execute all available test suits use:

```console
yarn test
```

It's also possible to execute and debug a single test file in VSCode/Theia via the File explorer.
Simply select a test file (`*.spec.ts`), then go to the `Run & Debug` View (`Ctrl+Shift+D`), select the 'Run current test" launch config and start debugging (`Ctrl+F11`)

## Start & Debug

The example server can be launched with:

```console
yarn start
```

To debug you can use the `Debug workflow example GLSP Server` launch configuration.
This starts the example server in a dedicated process. To test the server you have to connect a workflow GLSP client that supports JSON-RPC via socket.
We recommend to use the client provided by the [`glsp-integration`](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration#how-to-start-the-workflow-diagram-example-server-from-the-sources).
